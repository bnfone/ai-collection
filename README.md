This repository contains my custom GPTs for [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and Modelfiles for [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (local LLMs).


## Modelfiles
Modelfiles can be found in [`modelfiles/`](/modelfiles/).

To create a custom model in Ollama use this command:
```bash
ollama create choose-a-model-name -f ./name.modelfile
```

Please take a look to the [official Ollama Docs](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md) for more information.

## Prompts (GPTs)
ChatGPT GPTs can be found in [`prompts/`](/prompts/).

These can be tested using my links below:
- [VocabGPT_DE](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-KjisF4TX2-vocabgpt) 
  - A ChatGPT GPT, which creates a structured vocabulary list from a provided source text. *(Translated into German, but this can be easily changed in the prompt!)*
